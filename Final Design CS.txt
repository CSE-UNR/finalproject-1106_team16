Game Play
The user will be shown a menu where they can choose the following options:  [1] Load a new image, [2] Display current image, [3] Edit current image, [4] Exit program. Loading an image should attempt to read the information of an image from the provided file name. Choosing to edit the image will take the user to another menu where they will be prompted the following options: [1] Crop, [2] Dim, [3] Brighten, [4] Rotate image 90 degrees. “Crop image” will ask user for 4 coordinates where they would like to crop. Choosing “Dim” will subtract one brightness value from the original value from the file and display the image on the screen. “Brighten” will add one brightness value to the original value from the file. “Rotate” will. Choosing one of these options will end with their edited photo being printed on the screen. After editing the user will be asked if they would like to save the new image to a file, If the user agrees they will be asked for the file name. Once saved they will be returned to the first menu.
